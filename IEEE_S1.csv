Robots in social care and therapy have been a long time promise in HRI as they have the opportunity to improve patients life significantly. Multiple challenges have to be addressed for this, such as building platforms that work in proximity with patients, therapists and health-care professionals; understanding user needs; developing adaptive and autonomous robot interactions; and addressing ethical questions regarding the use of robots with a vulnerable population. The full-day workshop follows last year's edition which centered on how social robots can improve health-care interventions, how increasing the degree of autonomy of the robots might affect therapies, and how to overcome the ethical challenges inherent to the use of robot assisted technologies. This 2nd edition of the workshop will be focused on the importance of equipping social robots with socio-emotional intelligence and the ability to perform meaningful and personalized interactions. This workshop aims to bring together researchers and industry experts in the fields of Human-Robot Interaction, Machine Learning and Robots in Health and Social Care. It will be an opportunity for all to share and discuss ideas, strategies and findings to guide the design and development of robot-assisted systems for therapy and social care implementations that can provide personalize, natural, engaging and autonomous interactions with patients (and health-care providers).","2167-2148","978-1-5386-8555-6","10.1109/HRI.2019.8673243","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8673243","Social Robots;Robots in Therapy;Social Intelligence;Supervised Autonomy;Personalized Behaviors;Adaptive Behaviors","Medical treatment;Robot kinematics;Conferences;Human-robot interaction;Radio access technologies;Service robots","biomedical education;ethical aspects;health care;human-robot interaction;medical robotics;mobile robots;patient treatment","robot-assisted systems;social care implementations;health-care providers;social robots;health-care professionals;adaptive robot interactions;autonomous robot interactions;health-care interventions;robot assisted technologies;human-robot interaction;robot-assisted therapy","","11","","0","IEEE","25 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

During COVID times, many robots have been deployed in public places as social distancing enforcers, food delivery robots, UV-sanitation robots and more, but few studies have assessed the social situations of these robots. Using the context of robot distributing hand sanitizer, this work explores the benefits that social robots may provide to encouraging healthy human activities, as well as ways in which street-performance inspired approaches and a bit of humor might improve the quality and experience of functional human-robot interactions. After gaining human-in-the-loop deployment experience with a customized interface to enable both planned and improvized responses to human bystanders, we run two sub-studies. In the first, we compare the performance of the robot (moving or still) relative to a traditional hand sanitizer dispenser stick ($\mathrm{N}=2048$, 3 week data collection period). In the second, we evaluate how varied utterance strategies further impact the interaction results ($\mathrm{N}=185$, 2 week data collection period). The robot dramatically outperforms the stick dispenser across all tracked behavioral variables, cuing high levels of positive social engagement. This work finds the utterance design is more complex socially, and offer insights to future robot designers about how to integrate helpful and playful speech into service robot interactions. Finally, across both sub-studies, the work shows that people in groups are more likely to engage with the robot and each other, as well as sanitize their hands.","2153-0866","978-1-6654-7927-1","10.1109/IROS47612.2022.9981917","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9981917","Human-Robot-Interaction;Human-in-the-loop;Social Robotics;Service Robots;Entertainment Methods","COVID-19;Service robots;Social robots;Human factors;Data collection;Human in the loop;Social factors","health care;mobile robots;service robots;social robots;user interfaces","behavioral variables;customized interface;food delivery robots;functional human-robot interactions;hand sanitization;hand sanitizer dispenser stick;hand sanitizer distribution;healthy human activities;human bystanders;human-in-the-loop deployment experience;human-in-the-loop social robots;Oregon State University campus;positive social engagement;robot design;SanitizerBot;service robot interactions;social distancing;social situations;utterance design;UV-sanitation robots","","","","46","IEEE","26 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, SAR-assisted care raises ethical issues such as safety, dependence, privacy, dehumanization, etc. Although guidelines have been prepared for addressing these issues in the development process, some are beyond the responsibility of engineers. This paper argues for a role of healthcare professionals in ethically sound SAR-assisted care, connecting the concept of advance care planning (ACP) with the ethics of SAR. This process allows the care to reflect the preferences and values of care recipients, but there are several barriers to ACP in SAR-assisted care. This paper suggests measures for improving conduct of the ACP process: education, and community care. Decision-making that appropriately reflects the preferences of the care recipient enables SAR-assisted care to be ethically acceptable.","2162-7576","978-1-7281-3176-4","10.1109/ARSO46408.2019.8948742","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8948742","","Ethics;Privacy;Medical services;Aging;Rehabilitation robotics;Safety;Planning","ethical aspects;health care;human-robot interaction;medical robotics","advance care planning;care recipient;community care;aged care;socially assistive robotics;ethically sound SAR-assisted care;ACP;ethical issues","","","","29","IEEE","6 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address caregiver burden, we developed a robot-assisted psycho-educational program using a humanoid social robot for dementia caregivers. The intervention had 3 aims: to help caregivers prepare themselves for their roles in their care-giving journey, to teach caregivers techniques to mitigate stress and challenges of caregiving, and to prevent poor mental and physical health outcomes. A usability study was conducted with 9 caregivers to evaluate user experience and satisfaction with our program. Participants reported a positive user experience with the program and believed it would be useful to other dementia caregivers.

Such a task requires a high level of perception of the robotic agent. A high degree of perception requires considerable computational power, something challenging to achieve in mobile robotics. Robots need to balance operating time, batteries (autonomy and weight), embedded sensors, and processing hardware. One way to overcome the mobile agents' perception limitations is to move the data processing capabilities to external processing units. In this article, we present the initial results of the ROSANA platform, a socially interactive robot for public environments capable of interacting with humans in the wild. ROSANA has a high level of visual perception, thanks to an architecture based on cloud services. We named this approach as Perception as a Service - PPaaS.

However, efforts of teaching norms to robots have typically relied on single teaching methods (e.g., instruction, reward). By contrast, humans may naturally use more than one teaching method when training a novice. To test this claim in the domain of human-robot teaching, we present a novel paradigm in which participants interactively teach a simulated robot to behave appropriately in a healthcare setting, choosing to either instruct the robot or evaluate its proposed actions. We demonstrate that 89% of human teachers naturally adopt mixed teaching strategies. We further identify some of the factors that influence people's choices. Results reveal that human teachers dynamically update their impression of the robot from early to late in the teaching session, and they choose their teaching strategy based on the robot's specific actions and their accumulated perceptions of the robot's learning progress.","","978-1-6654-0731-1","10.1109/HRI53351.2022.9889555","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9889555","social robots;human-robot teaching","Training;Systematics;Education;Social robots;Medical services;Robot sensing systems;Robot learning","computer aided instruction;human computer interaction;human-robot interaction;learning (artificial intelligence);robots;teaching","human-robot teaching;simulated robot;healthcare setting;instruct;human teachers;mixed teaching strategies;influence people;teaching session;teaching strategy;people choose;teach norms;social robots;social settings;social norms;moral norms;single teaching methods;teaching method","","3","","20","IEEE","29 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Existing systems are mainly based on simplified protocols which qualitatively evaluate subject performance. We propose a robotic coaching platform for training social, motor and cognitive capabilities, with two main contributions: (i) using triadic interactions(adult, robot and child), with robotic mirroring, and (ii) providing quantitative performance indicators. The key system features were accurately designed, including type of protocols, feedback systems and evaluation metrics, contemplating the requirements for applications with ASD children. We implemented two protocols, Robot-Master and Adult-Master, where children performed different gestures guided by the robot or the adult respectively, eventually receiving feedback about movement execution. In both, the robot mirrors the subject during the movement. To assess system functionalities, with a homogeneous group of subjects, tests were carried out with 28 healthy subjects; one preliminary acquisition was done with an ASD child. Data analysis was customized to design protocol-specific parameters for movement characterization. Our tests show that robotic mirroring execution depends on the complexity and standardization of movements, as well as on the robot technical features. The feedback system evaluated movement phases and successfully estimated the completion of the exercises. Future work includes improving platform flexibility and adaptability, and clinical trials with ASD children to test the impact of the robotic coach on reducing symptoms. We trust that the proposed quantitative performance indicators extend the current state-of-the-art towards clinical usage of robotic-based coaching systems.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2021.3091320","Portuguese Foundation of Science and Technology(grant numbers:SFRH/BD/145040/2019,SFRH/BD/139092/2018); CerebNest (partnering project of the Human Brain Project) through the U.S. National Institutes of Health(grant numbers:1R01HD081346-01A); Subaward University of Southern California-Politecnico di Milano (USC-POLIMI)(grant numbers:61430868); Fondazione Zorzi through the Project Interactive mirrOring Games wIth sOCial rObot (IOGIOCO); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9461769","Robotic coaching;embodied mirroring;robotic therapy;human-robot interaction;movement metrics","Robots;Protocols;Variable speed drives;Training;Robot kinematics;Games;Shoulder","biomechanics;cognition;computer aided instruction;data analysis;handicapped aids;human-robot interaction;medical computing;medical disorders;medical robotics;mobile robots;paediatrics;patient treatment;protocols;robot programming","quantitative performance indicators;robotic-based coaching systems;robotic coach;ASD children;socially assistive robots;dyadic interactions;social skills;simplified protocols;subject performance;robotic coaching platform;motor;cognitive capabilities;triadic interactions;key system features;feedback system;evaluation metrics;Robot-Master;Adult-Master;movement execution;system functionalities;28 healthy subjects;ASD child;design protocol-specific parameters;movement characterization;robotic mirroring execution;robot technical features;movement phases","Adult;Autism Spectrum Disorder;Child;Cognition;Gestures;Humans;Robotic Surgical Procedures;Robotics","8","","28","CCBY","21 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we present the first human-robot interaction study with an autonomous multi-task socially assistive robot used for non-contact screening in long-term care homes. The robot monitors temperature, checks for face masks, and asks screening questions to minimize human-to-human contact. We investigated staff perceptions of 7 attributes: screening experience without and with the robot, efficiency, cognitive attitude, freeing up staff, safety, affective attitude, and intent to use the robot. Furthermore, we investigated the influence of demographics on these attributes. Study results show that, overall, staff rated these attributes high for the screening robot, with a statistically significant increase in cognitive attitude and safety after interacting with the robot.

The utilization of technology, especially an implementation of robot technology, can help humans in this regard. In addition to the environment sector, there is a high demand for robots in other sectors due to the development of new technologies such as artificial intelligence. The robot industry is in urgent need of professional and applied talents. Additionally, recent social development has put forth urgent requirements for progressive robotic education. In order to cultivate innovative talents, enhance students’ practical ability and promote the intelligent development of robots towards a green environment, an educational trash can robot has been developed. It helps to stimulate students’ interest in scientific research, is cultivates innovative talents and promotes the further development of higher technology such as artificial intelligence.

In this paper, we build on affordable research-grade mobility aids for young children and consider how to design and evaluate an assistive robot that can support the use of these devices. With young children’s contingency learning abilities in mind, we designed an assistive mobile robot capable of supplying age-appropriate light, sound, and bubble rewards. We conducted a first evaluation of the robot’s ability to support driving practice with N = 5 typically developing infants. The results indicate mixed success of the robot rewards; driving distances uniformly tended to fall over the course of the study, but children did tend to look at the robot. In a second exploratory study involving N = 6 children in free ambulatory play, we see clearer differences in gaze and behavior from the introduction of an assistive robot.

Earlier research has demonstrated how social robots could help improve motivation and increase the performance of children practicing music pieces. As important stakeholders, the attitudes and expec- tations of parents and music teachers are important factors that affect children’s and their own acceptance of applying social robots in music education. In this study, a survey was created and used to assess parents’ and music teachers’ attitudes, expectations, and intentions related to using social robots in music education. The survey results suggested that parents and music teachers expect robots to act as assistive and motivating agents, give positive feedback, and schedule and structure practice sessions. Moreover, parents expect a social robot to evaluate student performance, while music teachers focus more on positive encouragement. The biggest concerns of these stakeholders are whether the robots can convey the emotional aspects of music and demonstrate how to play the instrument. The intention of using robots is positively correlated with positive attitudes towards robots in general and the positive attitude towards robots specifically in the context of music education. The current study contributes insights into parents’ and music teachers’ attitudes and expectations as determinants of their acceptance of of social robots in music education, and provides a method for measuring these attitudes and expectations.","1944-9437","978-1-7281-8859-1","10.1109/RO-MAN53752.2022.9900727","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9900727","Social robots for music education;Expectations for social robots;Stakeholders’ attitudes to social robots;Intentions of technology use;TAM","Training;Schedules;Pediatrics;Instruments;Current measurement;Scholarships;Social robots","computer aided instruction;educational robots;human factors;music;musical instruments;social robots;teaching","music education;social robot;music pieces;musical instrument learning;parent expectation;music teacher attitude;assistive agents;motivating agents;positive encouragement;practice session scheduling","","","","28","IEEE","30 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Under the proposed framework, we implement a novel social robot and deploy it in the challenging learning context, which demands the robot provide natural interactions and autonomous learning supports to adult learners. The evaluation results show that the robot significantly improves the learners' intrinsic motivation, and the adult learners have also shown great interests in learning and communicating with the robot.

To realize our study, we have deployed a model for the integration of a humanoid assistant robot in an educational environment. The assistant robot should supervise, assist, encourage, and socially interact with learners to acquire information about their personality types. The Negative Attitude Scale toward Robots (NARS) and the Myers Briggs Type Indicator MBTI personality test was used to collect the data. The results indicate the personality types of the participants that are most dominant. The results also show a positive correlation value that should not be neglected between personality type and negative attitudes towards robots.

The potential shown by social robots in teaching non-curricular topics is a promising motivation for exploring their use in this context. Indeed, a social robot could offer children the possibility to discuss gender (in)equality with an intelligent entity that is neither male nor female, but rather a credible outsider with respect to mankind. In this article we present the design process of a social robot, named PixelBot, and associated robot-mediated storytelling activity aimed at raising awareness of gender (in)equality among children. We used a participatory design approach involving 20 children aged 1013 to acquire (i) their opinion on how a robot should look like and (ii) stories featuring robots and gender (in)equality.

The students’ data were collected and analyzed using PLS-SEM. The study findings revealed that 12 hypotheses were accepted and two were rejected. The results indicate that students are willing to accept AI-based robots in their education. However, the findings revealed an insignificant influence of job relevance and robot anxiety on perceived usefulness and ease of use, respectively. The findings of this study will provide insight into university administrations regarding the significance of AI-based robots in education. Moreover, the findings will help robot developers, policymakers, and university administrators design and implement AI-based robots that fulfill contemporary education needs.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3314499","King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia(grant numbers:RSP2023/R251); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10247529","AI-based robot;education;TAM3;perceived usefulness;perceived ease of use;behavioral intention","Robots;Education;Artificial intelligence;Anxiety disorders;Social robots;Service robots;Employment;Behavioral sciences","artificial intelligence;computer aided instruction;educational institutions;educational robots;further education;least squares approximations;statistical analysis;technology acceptance model","adopt artificial intelligence-based robots;AI-based robots;Chinese higher education students;PLS-SEM;TAM;technology acceptance model 3 model","","","","82","CCBYNCND","12 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The promising future and long-term potential of such robots can only be guessed at on the basis of today's pilot applications in many areas. In the field of higher education, only a few attempts have been made to integrate social robots sustainably into educational processes. This research paper presents an approach to integrate the robot model Pepper into educational processes via a learning management system. The goal is to explore and evaluate the perceived benefits and potential of a robot-based learning environment with adaptive educational content from the learning management system (e.g., course content, quiz, survey). An evaluation based on interviews with preservice teachers in business education forms the basis for identifying design implications and for further development. The results of the explorative interview study indicate the relevance of an integration of social robots with learning processes. However, the perceived adaptiveness and educational functionality of the robot within the presented learning environment were limited compared to its positively perceived hedonistic purpose. These findings suggest that technically and pedagogically integrated social robots can be beneficial in facilitating learning, but that their adaptiveness and social capabilities need to be further developed in order to make them effective in this context.","1944-9437","978-1-7281-8859-1","10.1109/RO-MAN53752.2022.9900622","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9900622","","Learning management systems;Adaptation models;Adaptive systems;Social robots;Education;Interviews;Business","control engineering computing;educational robots;further education;learning management systems;social robots","social robots;learning management system;social interaction;educational processes;robot-based learning;adaptive educational content;social capabilities;Pepper robot model;higher education;robot-based learning environment;preservice teachers;business education;perceived adaptiveness;educational functionality","","1","","23","IEEE","30 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Technologies such as Augmented Reality (AR) and Socially Assistive Robots (SAR) have been successfully used in the last years in the educational field. Therefore, it is essential to identify how social robots and AR educational tools can be optimally used to support traffic safety education. In this paper, we introduce the idea of an educational approach with the combination of SAR with AR technologies to teach traffic safety in kindergarten. We have been inspired by evidence from human-robot interaction studies, suggesting both technologies can enhance gained knowledge using the storytelling method at an early age and trigger positive attitudes in the students after interacting with them. Our educational approach was benchmarked against a single AR application. Our study initially proved, through real-world experiments, that the combination of SAR and AR was successfully used to teach kindergarten students about traffic safety. It managed to sustain their attention for statistically significantly more time than the case of the single AR application. Students taught by the single AR application also managed to gain basic knowledge regarding traffic safety. Moreover, another important outcome of our study is that students improved their attitudes and beliefs regarding using SAR in education after interacting with it, as demonstrated by individual interviews. Hence, our results suggest that both AR applications and SAR are suitable for learning purposes in kindergarten, while the employment of SAR in AR educational applications sustains the students’ attention.","1944-9437","979-8-3503-3670-2","10.1109/RO-MAN57019.2023.10309658","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10309658","human robot interaction;traffic safety;socially assistive robot (SAR);Augmented Reality (AR);kindergarten","Roads;Education;Social robots;Employment;Benchmark testing;Assistive robots;Safety","","","","","","27","IEEE","13 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By employing regular question-and-answer conversations or wearable devices, some social robotics products can establish personal health archives. But those robots are unable to collect diet information automatically through robot vision or audition. A healthy diet can reduce a person's risk of developing cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and other age-related diseases. In order to automatically perceive the dietary composition of the elderly by listening to people's chatting, this paper proposed a chat-based automatic dietary composition perception algorithm (DCPA). DCPA uses social robot audition to understand the semantic information and percept dietary composition for Mandarin Chinese. Firstly, based on the Mel-frequency cepstrum coefficient and convolutional neural network, a speaker recognition method is designed to identify speech data. Based on speech segmentation and speaker recognition algorithm, an audio segment classification method is proposed to distinguish different speakers, store their identity information and the sequence of expression in a speech conversation. Secondly, a dietetic lexicon is established, and two kinds of dietary composition semantic understanding algorithms are proposed to understand the eating semantics and sensor dietary composition information. To evaluate the performance of the proposed DCPA algorithm, we implemented the proposed DCPA in our social robot platform. Then we established two categories of test datasets relating to a one-person and a multi-person chat. The test results show that DCPA is capable of understanding users' dietary compositions, with an F1 score of 0.9505, 0.8940 and 0.8768 for one-person talking, a two-person chat and a three-person chat, respectively. DCPA has good robustness for obtaining dietary information.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2963560","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61863005,91746116); Guizhou Science and Technology Department(grant numbers:PTRC[2018]5702,QKHZC[2019]2814,[2018]5781); Fund for Hundred High-level Innovative Scholars of Guizhou Province; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8948011","Dietary composition perception;semantic understanding;robot audition;social robot;text information extraction","Robot sensing systems;Semantics;Data mining;Senior citizens;Robot kinematics;Feature extraction","audio signal processing;cepstral analysis;convolutional neural nets;feature extraction;geriatrics;health care;medical computing;signal classification;speaker recognition;speech processing","convolutional neural network;mel-frequency cepstrum coefficient;social robot platform;DCPA algorithm;sensor dietary composition information;speech conversation;identity information;audio segment classification method;speaker recognition algorithm;speech segmentation;speaker recognition method;semantic information;chat-based automatic dietary composition perception algorithm;diet information;personal health archives;social robotics products;aging population;Mandarin Chinese;social robot audition","","56","","47","CCBY","1 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Thus, in this paper we propose a measurement system composed of multi-PIR sensors mounted on the head of a mobile social robot in which the granularity of the overlapped field of view (FoV) of sensors are considered to increase the localization accuracy. In addition, a Decision Tree (DT) classifier algorithm is trained on the system data to improve the localization accuracy.

To endow the robot with the capability to play as a game opponent in a real-world context, we implemented an image recognition module based on a Convolutional Neural Network so that the robot could detect and classify the waste material as a child would do, by seeing it. After a preliminary evaluation of the approach, we started a formal experiment in which we measured the effectiveness of game design, the robot evaluation and the evaluation of cognitive and affective elements that can form the pro-environmental attitude and then the tendency to recycling. A primary school classroom was involved in the study and, results obtained so far, are encouraging and drew promising possibilities for robotics education in changing recycling attitude for children since Pepper is positively evaluated as trustful and believable and this allowed to be concentrated on the `memorization' task during the game.","2380-7350","978-1-7281-4793-2","10.1109/CogInfoCom47531.2019.9089994","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9089994","Social robots;serious games;evaluation","Games;Robots;Recycling;Plastic products;Analysis of variance;Education;Waste materials","computer aided instruction;convolutional neural nets;educational robots;image recognition;recycling;serious games (computing);teaching","serious games;game opponent;waste material;social robot;real-world context;image recognition module;convolutional neural network;game design;robot evaluation;pro-environmental attitude;robotics education;changing recycling attitude;social robots;children attitudes","","3","","23","IEEE","11 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Reasons for hindering WR provision to our society include the absence of clear assessment criteria and social implementation process models. While some care institutions and private homes promoted and integrated WR successfully, large part of our society have struggled to identify ways of appropriating the WR provision. Based on the investigation on seven successful organizations on evaluation and implementation practices, the research extracted key aspects for WR provision in society.

This exploratory study examined whether humans pay attention to cues of falsehood or deceit when interacting with ASAs. To infer such epistemic vigilance, participants' N400 brain signals were analyzed in response to discrepancies between a robot's physical appearance and its speech, and ratings were collected for statements about the robot's cognitive ability. First results suggest that humans do exhibit epistemic vigilance, as evidenced 1) by a more pronounced N400 component when participants heard sentences contradicting the robot's physical abilities and 2) by overall lower rating scores for the robot's cognitive abilities. However, approximately two-thirds of participants showed a “concealed capacity bias,” whereby they reported believing that the robot could have concealed arms or legs, despite physical evidence to the contrary. This bias, referred to as the “Eve effect bias” reduced the N400 effect and amplified the perception of the robot, suggesting that individuals influenced by this bias may be less critical of the accuracy and plausibility of information provided by artificial agents. Consequently, humans may accept information from ASAs even when it contradicts common sense. These findings emphasize the need for transparency, unbiased information processing, and user education about the limitations and capabilities of ASAs.","2162-7576","978-1-6654-6424-6","10.1109/ARSO56563.2023.10187469","Université de Lille(grant numbers:FR CNRS 2052 SCV); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10187469","","Legged locomotion;Social robots;Information processing;Robot sensing systems;Manipulators;Robots","cognition;social robots","artificial social agents;ASA;cognitive ability;concealed capacity bias;epistemic vigilance;Eve effect bias;human belief;physical abilities;physical appearance;physical evidence;social robots","","","","41","IEEE","25 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although these robots bring about different advantages to mediated communication, telepresence pilots have been found to be perceived less favorably than people who are physically present in a communicative context [1]. Thus, in the current work, to mitigate the negative effects of using a telepresence robot, we examine whether an intervention to elicit empathy can influence the way remote participants are perceived. To this end, in a within-subject design, we asked participants (N=30) to follow text-based instructions to do a language learning activity in groups of three, in which one of the participants used a GoBe telepresence robot to join other co-situated group members. We embedded an intervention designed to create empathy with the telepresence operator in the last section of the activity and used two questionnaires, one before and one after the intervention, to collect participants' subjective evaluations of each other. Findings suggest that after the empathy-eliciting question, participants found the telepresence robot user significantly more trustworthy, reliable, and fascinated by art, music, or literature. Results indicate that the empathy-eliciting intervention has a positive effect on the way collocated participants perceive telepresence users.","2162-7576","978-1-6654-6424-6","10.1109/ARSO56563.2023.10187570","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10187570","","Telepresence;Art;Medical services;Reliability;Robots","computer aided instruction;health care;virtual reality","communicative context;different advantages;empathy-eliciting intervention;empathy-eliciting question;GoBe telepresence robot;mediated communication;remote individuals;telepresence operator;telepresence pilots;telepresence robot user;telepresence users;way remote participants","","","","33","IEEE","25 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

During robotic telepresence, we have shown that embodiment into robots can be promoted by reciprocal and synchronous stimuli in the form of intentional movements or passive tactile stimulations. Here we investigate the impact of different spatial perspectives coupled to these sensory-motor manipulations on human subjects’ social perception of robots. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that independent of the telepresence vs. face-to-face self-perspective, the sense of agency as induced by synchronous human-robot movements is crucial for generating positive changes of robot acceptability.

However, due to the high number of degrees of freedom in humanoids, it is hard for teleoperated humanoid systems to be versatile and intuitive to use in the same time. Those that are capable of a large variety of tasks usually require the operator to master a complicated control interface; and humanoids that can be teleoperated simply by joysticks or haptic devices are often limited to a few preprogrammed tasks. This paper presents a humanoid teleoperation system where the robot's full body can be teleoperated intuitively by a human operator to complete various tasks and it requires minimal training on the operator. It is built with a human-sized humanoid robot with a stereo camera on its head, a VR headset which provides the operator with a 3D first-person view from that camera and a motion capture suit that records the operator's full-body movement. Matching algorithms are carefully designed between the operator's and robot's full-body motion so that the former can move freely during teleoperation.

Firstly, using a binocular depth vision camera, real-time target information from a firstperson perspective is collected, and a lightweight deep learning model is employed to detect the relative position of the human body posture with respect to the social robot. Subsequently, to address the issue of unsmooth trajectory during the tracking process, a dual-axis PID algorithm is developed for cooperative control of the robot’s speed and heading angle. Given the inherent randomness in human body movement, target loss can occur during tracking. To enhance the algorithm’s robustness, a dynamic tracking mechanism is introduced. Finally, we implement a vision-driven two-wheel differential social robot following algorithm on the ROS system and validate it through three real-world experimental scenarios. The mean values of the target acquisition rate, tracked target position, and angle smoothness are found to be 0.81, 0.46, and 1.02, respectively.","2835-3358","979-8-3503-0732-0","10.1109/WRCSARA60131.2023.10261835","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10261835","","Target tracking;Heuristic algorithms;Scalability;Social robots;Object detection;Radar tracking;Search problems","cameras;computer vision;deep learning (artificial intelligence);mobile robots;object detection;position control;robot vision","binocular depth vision camera;deep vision object detection;differential social robot;dual-axis PID algorithm;dynamic tracking mechanism;human body movement;human body posture;lightweight deep learning model;mobile robots;object-oriented services;real-time target information;real-time tracking;target loss;tracked target position;tracking process;vision guided mobile robot dual axis PID dynamic;vision-driven two-wheel","","","","24","IEEE","27 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated the issues associated with limited staff who are overworked. Such a scenario also disrupted the research and development of socially assistive robots (SARs) as access to care facilities and the elderly was restricted. The restriction sparked creative thinking and innovation aimed at addressing the challenges introduced by the pandemic. Such is the case for developing Aether™, a SAR designed to monitor falls and engage in playful activities with users. This paper presents the use of game technologies to develop a Virtual reality digital twin simulator for overcoming the lack of access to LTCFs and the elderly by creating synthetic data that simulates the robot's behavior, interactions with the environment, and virtual avatars, before its deployment. Our approach additionally allows overcoming the limitation with traditional datasets for training machine learning where depicted people and actions are not representative of the elderly population. Our preliminary results indicate that combining DTs and VR expedites robot development.

Therefore, it is important to identify the future educators’ attitudes towards the use of robots and technological tools. In this paper, we investigate how the exposure of students/pre-service teachers in a robot-tutor can affect their attitudes towards the use of robots in education. We compare a university professor with a robot-tutor in a university class and we demonstrate how each one changes the students’ attitudes towards the use of robots and technology in education as well as the students learning outcome from the course. Furthermore, based on the results of the four experiments we conducted, we also demonstrate the changes in students’ attitudes when they have just a single lesson with a robot-tutor and when they have two courses. Our results demonstrate all students were more positive about the use of robots (and technology) in education after having a course with the robot-tutor than when they had a lecture with a human. Moreover, they had a similar knowledge acquisition level, as indicated by the given knowledge test in both human and robot-tutor conditions. Especially in the case that they had a second lecture with the robot-tutor, they got statistically significantly higher scores in the test in comparison with those who had only one lecture. Our results suggest that a robot-tutor can be an effective tutor, capable of changing students’ attitudes and improving knowledge.

Traditional RT requires professionals' facilitation, limiting its accessibility to PLWD. Social robotics has the potential to facilitate RT, enabling accessible home-based RT. However, studies are needed to investigate how PLWD would perceive a robot-mediated reminiscence therapy (RMRT) and how to develop RMRT for positive user experience and successful adoption. In this article, we develop a prototype of RMRT using a humanoid social robot and test it with 12 participants (seven PLWD, two with mild cognitive impairment, and three informal caregivers). The robot automatically displays a memory trigger on its tablet and engages participants in a relatable conversation during RMRT. A mixed-method approach is employed to assess its acceptability and usability. Our results show that PLWD have an overall positive user experience with the RMRT. Participants laugh and sing along with the robot during RMRT and demonstrate intention to use it. In addition, we discuss a robot control method and several critical problems for RMRT. The RMRT can facilitate both verbal and nonverbal social interaction for PLWD and holds promise for engaging, personalized, and efficient home-based cognitive exercises for PLWD.","1941-0468","","10.1109/TRO.2023.3272846","National Institutes of Health(grant numbers:R01AG077003); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10136814","Alzheimer's disease;cognitive exercise;dementia care;reminiscence therapy (RT);social robots","Robots;Videos;Usability;Oral communication;Social robots;Chatbots;Graphical user interfaces","cognition;diseases;geriatrics;human computer interaction;human-robot interaction;humanoid robots;medical computing;neurophysiology","accessible home-based RT;Alzheimer's disease;Alzheimer's-disease;cognitive exercise;efficient home-based cognitive exercises;engaging home-based cognitive exercises;humanoid social robot;mild cognitive impairment;nonverbal social interaction;personalized, home-based cognitive exercises;positive user experience;professionals;relatable conversation;related dementia;RMRT;robot control method;robot-mediated reminiscence therapy;seven PLWD;social robotics;verbal interaction","","","","56","IEEE","26 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We target two most common yet divergent problems from Individualized Education Plans (IEPs) of ASD children - communication and gross motor skills. We present results from three studies a) toy robot Cozmo assists SEs in verbal lessons in school premises, b) mini drone Tello helps SEs in exercise lessons in school premises, and c) Cozmo, SEs, and ASD children connect remotely, as mandated due to the Covid-19 pandemic, for verbal lessons. All three studies showed improvement in learning outcomes and reduction in prompts from the SEs, denoting reduced workload. The effect of a robot's virtual presence in online ASD interventions has not been studied before. However, our results show that children spent more time on lessons in online intervention with Cozmo, suggesting that using robots should also be considered when designing online interventions. Furthermore, the roles of Cozmo were analyzed, and we found children showed increased spontaneous interaction when Cozmo acts as a Co-Instructor. Thus, preliminary results indicate toy robots, as opposed to expensive humanoids, may have significant potential in aiding SEs in Autism education.","2577-087X","978-1-7281-9077-8","10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9561633","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9561633","","Autism;Pandemics;Robot kinematics;Toy manufacturing industry;Education;Humanoid robots;Variable speed drives","computer aided instruction;handicapped aids;humanoid robots;human-robot interaction;medical disorders;robot vision;teaching","nonhumanoid social robots reduce workload;Special Educators;In-Premises Field Study;Socially Assistive Robotics;Autism Spectrum Disorder interventions;SEs;expensive humanoid robots;nonhumanoid toy robots;ASD Education;Individualized Education Plans;ASD children - communication;toy robot Cozmo;verbal lessons;school premises;reduced workload;online ASD interventions;online intervention;designing online interventions;expensive humanoids;Autism education","","","","36","IEEE","18 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Simulation results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in complex environment where the proposed algorithm converged in less than 50% of the iterations taken by the exhaustive search algorithms and approximately 33% of the iterations taken by random search algorithm.

Adding jumping motion to the robot can greatly enhance the robot's ability to adapt to the environment. This paper explores the forward jumping of the humanoid robot. A simplified three-link model of the humanoid robot in the sagittal plane is established and the jumping process is decomposed into three phases: take-off phase, flight phase, and landing phase. The mathematical model for each phase of the forward jumping of the humanoid robot is developed. In the whole process, motors provide torques for the three joints of the robot's hip joint, knee joint and ankle joint. Then the kinematics and dynamics are constrained for each phase, and the cost function is established. Furthermore, the pseudo-spectral method is used to optimize the design of the jumping trajectory to ensure the forward jumping of the humanoid robot. Finally, the validity of the proposed method for the whole forward jumping process is verified by the simulation experiment. The simulation result shows that the model of the humanoid robot can achieve 0.85 meters forward jumping.","2162-7576","978-1-7281-3176-4","10.1109/ARSO46408.2019.8948791","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8948791","","","humanoid robots;legged locomotion;robot dynamics;torque","forward jumping movement;humanoid robot;jumping process;take-off phase;flight phase;landing phase;sagittal plane;crawling movement patterns;walking patterns","","","","21","IEEE","6 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we investigate the interference in emotional response and acceptance of a robot to home living tasks and suggestion behaviors. Our hypothesis is that the shape of the robots affects the acceptance, specially when the robot was to suggest or give some orders to humans.

Therefore, it is important to understand whether similar or dissimilar opinions or attitudes of a focal subject held by the user and robot affects the user’s perception of the robot and future adoption intentions. We propose that robot design (positive facial expressions and verbal sentiments) may moderate the effect of attitude dissimilarity on robot perception. It is well-documented in the psychology literature that attitude similarity affects human-human relationships; however, no such study has been undertaken in human-robot interactions. Our results showed that when the robot expressed its views using a neutral facial expression and verbal sentiment, attitude similarity influenced robot perception, i.e., those participants who had similar (vs. dissimilar) attitudes as the robot perceived the robot to be positive (vs. negative). However, when the robot expressed its opinion with a positive facial expression and verbal sentiment, participants judged the robot as positive regardless of attitude similarity between the user and the robot. These results indicate that positive facial expressions and the verbal sentiment of a robot can nullify any negative effect when a user and a robot share very different opinions.","1944-9437","978-1-7281-8859-1","10.1109/RO-MAN53752.2022.9900609","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9900609","","Social robots;Education;Psychology;Medical services;Older adults;Robots","face recognition;health care;human computer interaction;human factors;human-robot interaction;mobile robots;psychology;robots","human-human relationships;human-robot interactions;neutral facial expression;verbal sentiment;attitude similarity;robot perception;positive facial expression;robot share very different opinions;social robot;negative user perceptions;attitudinally dissimilar interactions;dissimilar opinions;future adoption intentions;robot design;attitude dissimilarity","","","","37","IEEE","30 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We demonstrate that robot displays of goodwill and similarity to the participant significantly increased robot persuasiveness, as measured objectively by participant behaviour. However, such strategies had no impact on subjective measures concerning perception of the robot, and perception of the robot did not correlate with participant behaviour. We hypothesise that this is due to difficulty in accurately measuring perception of a robot using subjective measures. We suggest our results are particularly relevant for the design and development of socially assistive robots.","2167-2148","978-1-5386-8555-6","10.1109/HRI.2019.8673313","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8673313","Socially Assistive Robots;Persuasion;User-Study","Robots;Atmospheric measurements;Particle measurements;Task analysis;Receivers;Medical treatment;Wrist","human factors;human-robot interaction","effective persuasion strategies;socially assistive robots;human persuasive strategies;social robot;robot persuasiveness;participant behaviour;subjective measures;robot perception","","39","","31","IEEE","25 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The algorithm is based on the second-order sliding mode control known as Super-Twisting Algorithm (STA) which is able to eliminate the “chattering” phenomenon and ensure robustness with respect to bounded disturbances. The stability of the closed-loop system can be guaranteed according to Lyapunov theorem. In order to show the effectiveness of the proposed controller, a simulation was carried out to make the basic MWIP model move at a constant speed. Additional simulation-testings considering model uncertainties and external disturbances were also provided to verify the effectiveness and robustness of the STA. Comparisons with the Sliding Mode Control (SMC) were given to demonstrate the superiorities of the STA and the results show the favorable performance of the proposed controller in terms of chattering elimination and robustness.","2162-7576","978-1-5386-8037-7","10.1109/ARSO.2018.8625817","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8625817","Mobile Wheeled Inverted Pendulum;Super-Twisting Algorithm;Velocity Control;Chattering Elimination","Lyapunov methods;Wheels;Sliding mode control;Robustness;Velocity control;Robots;Technological innovation","closed loop systems;control system synthesis;Lyapunov methods;mobile robots;nonlinear control systems;pendulums;robust control;variable structure systems;velocity control;wheels","nonlinear control algorithm;STA;bounded disturbances;closed-loop system;external disturbances;velocity control;controller design;sliding mode control;MWIP model;super-twisting algorithm;mobile wheeled inverted pendulum;Lyapunov theorem;SMC","","1","","21","IEEE","27 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While breaking up long periods of sitting can alleviate these issues, no scalable interventions have had long-term success in motivating activity breaks at work. We believe that socially assistive robotics (SAR), which combines the scalability of e-health interventions with the motivational social ability of a companion or coach, may offer a solution for changing sedentary habits. To begin this work, we designed a SAR system and conducted a within-subjects study with N = 19 participants to compare their experiences taking breaks using the SAR system versus an alarm-like device for one day each in participants' normal workplaces. Results indicate that both systems had similar effects on sedentary behavior, but the SAR system led to greater feelings of pleasure, enjoyment, and engagement. Interviews yielded design recommendations for future systems. We find that SAR systems hold promise for further investigations of aiding healthy habit formation in work settings.","2153-0866","978-1-7281-6212-6","10.1109/IROS45743.2020.9341291","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9341291","","Scalability;Employment;Rehabilitation robotics;Interviews;Research and development;Intelligent robots","behavioural sciences computing;ergonomics;health care;human factors;human-robot interaction;mobile computing;synthetic aperture radar","socially assistive robots;break-taking interventions;health issues;excess sedentary behavior;scalable interventions;long-term success;motivating activity breaks;socially assistive robotics;e-health interventions;motivational social ability;sedentary habits;SAR system;participants;work settings","","3","","40","IEEE","10 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The interest in this subject results from the need of modern society to develop social robots that can engage and support users for long periods of time. A large portion of the population should benefit from this kind of research as for example, people with physical or intellectual disability. This paper presents an evolution of the architecture called Cognitive Model Development Environment (CMDE) to meet the requirements of applications involving long-term interaction. The proposed evolution includes three features. The first one develops the concept of Memory in OntPercept ontology to represent memory information records. The idea is to explore the versatility offered by relationship representation in ontologies. The second feature introduces Forgetting abstraction that allows the control of memory volume using reasoning tools also inherent to ontologies. Third, evolve the Robot House Simulator (RHS) by including new human avatars to represent different ages and behaviors.","2643-685X","978-1-7281-4268-5","10.1109/LARS-SBR-WRE48964.2019.00061","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9018463","Social Robotics;Cognition;Simulation;Human Robot Interaction","Robot sensing systems;Ontologies;Cognition;Computer architecture;Cognitive systems;Registers","human-robot interaction;ontologies (artificial intelligence)","long-term interaction;robot house simulator;social robots;cognitive model development environment;human-robot interaction;OntPercept ontology;Forgetting abstraction","","1","","19","IEEE","2 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Tutor robots offer new opportunities for curriculum development, motivating students, stimulating interest and developing soft skills, while preparing young people to use the latest technological tools. In our online survey, conducted in summer 2022, we explored the views of educators in 14 countries on the characteristics of robot-supported innovation in higher education. The results of the survey show that educators are open to educational innovations. Educational robots are mainly used for teaching programming. They believe that the use of social robots significantly improves students’ creativity and self-expression. The results of this research have shown that the use of educational social robots is an excellent opportunity for methodological innovation and provides scope for experimental teaching.","2765-818X","979-8-3503-2110-4","10.1109/SACI58269.2023.10158668","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10158668","Methodological innovation;robots;survey","Surveys;Training;Technological innovation;Educational robots;Education;Social robots;Task analysis","computer aided instruction;educational courses;educational robots;further education;teaching","educational innovations;educational social robots;experimental teaching;higher education;robot-supported innovation;soft skills;teaching assistants;teaching programming;technological developments;tutor robots","","","","26","IEEE","27 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
